# Why Read (Or Reread) These Papers?

## If You Are Reading Them For The First Time

The field of Generative AI is moving quickly, and it is easy to get lost in the hype of new model releases and rely on secondary summaries. Modern AI is not magic; it is a stack of specific engineering breakthroughs. By reading these foundational papers, you will stop treating LLMs as mysterious black boxes. You will understand how text is tokenized, how attention mechanisms work, why models can hallucinate, and how techniques like LoRA make fine-tuning practical. This reading list is meant to take you from being an API consumer to someone who understands the architecture.

## If You Have Already Read Them, Why Reread?

Context changes everything. When "Attention Is All You Need" or "The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration" were published, the landscape looked very different. Rereading them today, with the hindsight of the ChatGPT era, reveals nuances that are easy to miss. You will see how early decisions (like BPE and nucleus sampling) became industry standards. Reading interpretability papers alongside alignment papers like LIMA also makes the narrative clearer: one paper often solves the bottleneck created by the previous one.
