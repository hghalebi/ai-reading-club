# Organizer Tips

1. Pacing matters: Biweekly is usually the sweet spot for dense papers.
2. Assign a discussion lead: Each session needs someone to prepare a 3-5 slide, 10-15 minute summary.
3. Prepare guiding questions: Add 3 open-ended questions before the session to avoid a cold start.
4. Do not get stuck on the heavy math: Focus on the abstract, intro, diagrams, and conclusion if needed.
5. Share paper links: Keep one place with links (arXiv, arxiv-vanity, alphaXiv) so participants do not have to hunt.
