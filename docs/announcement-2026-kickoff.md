# AI Reading Club (Kickoff Announcement)

## Headline

Join the AI Reading Club: From BPE to Transformers to Alignment (13-paper curriculum)

## Body

I am starting a biweekly AI Reading Club to read and discuss the papers that built modern LLMs. The goal is to understand the actual engineering breakthroughs (tokenization, self-attention, decoding, efficiency, and alignment), not just consume API summaries.

We will meet every two weeks on Wednesdays, starting **Wednesday, March 4, 2026**.

### How it works

- Cadence: Biweekly Wednesdays
- Format: 10-15 minute volunteer summary, then ~45 minutes discussion
- Summer break: No sessions in August
- Holidays: If a session lands on a holiday, we skip that week and meet the following Wednesday

### First session

- Date: Wednesday, March 4, 2026
- Time: TBD ([your time zone])
- Paper: Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units (BPE, 2015)
- Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909
